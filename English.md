#### never enough lyrics
```
[Verse]
I'm tryin' to hold my breath
Let it stay this way
Can't let this moment end
You set off a dream in me
Getting louder now
Can you hear it echoing?

[Pre-Chorus]
Take my hand
Will you share this with me?
'Cause darling, without you

[Chorus]
All the shine of a thousand spotlights
All the stars we steal from the night sky
Will never be enough, never be enough
Towers of gold are still too little
These hands could hold the world but it'll
Never be enough, never be enough

[Post-Chorus]
For me, never, never
Never, never
Never, for me, for me
Never enough, never enough, never enough
For me, for me, for me

[Chorus]
All the shine of a thousand spotlights
All the stars we steal from the night sky
Will never be enough, never be enough
Towers of gold are still too little
These hands could hold the world but it'll
Never be enough, never be enough

[Post-Chorus]
For me, never, never
Never, never
Never, for me, for me
Never enough, never, never
Never enough, never, never
Never enough
For me, for me, for me

[Outro]
For me
