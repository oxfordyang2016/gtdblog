[English Lyrics]

[Verse 1]
May it be an evening star
Shines down upon you
May it be when darkness falls
Your heart will be true
You walk a lonely road
Oh! How far you are from home

[Chorus]
Mornië utúlië
Believe and you will find your way
Mornië alantië
A promise lives within you now

[Verse 2]
May it be the shadow's call
Will fly away
May it be you journey on
To light the day
When the night is overcome
You may rise to find the sun

[Chorus]
Mornië utúlië
Believe and you will find your way
Mornië alantië
A promise lives within you now

[Outro]
A promise lives within you now
```



#### how does a moment  last forever
```
[Verse 1]
How does a moment last forever?
How can a story never die?
It is love we must hold onto
Never easy, but we try
Sometimes our happiness is captured
Somehow, our time and place stand still
Love lives on inside our hearts and always will

[Chorus]
Minutes turn to hours, days to years then gone
But when all else has been forgotten
Still our song lives on

[Verse 2]
Maybe some moments weren’t so perfect
Maybe some memories not so sweet
But we have to know some bad times
Or our lives are incomplete
Then when the shadows overtake us
Just when we feel all hope is gone
We’ll hear our song and know once more
Our love lives on

[Verse 3]
How does a moment last forever?
How does our happiness endure?
Through the darkest of our troubles
Love is beauty, love is pure
Love pays no mind to desolation
It flows like a river through the soul
Protects, proceeds, and perseveres
And makes us whole

[Chorus]
Minutes turn to hours, days to years then gone
But when all else has been forgotten
Still our song lives on

[Outro]
How does a moment last forever
When our song lives on
```

### into the west
```
Lay down
Your sweet and weary head
Night is falling
You have come to journey's end
Sleep now
And dream of the ones who came before
They are calling
From across the distant shore

Why do you weep?
What are these tears upon your face?
Soon you will see
All of your fears will pass away
Safe in my arms
You're only sleeping

[Chorus]
What can you see
On the horizon?
Why do the white gulls call?
Across the sea
A pale moon rises
The ships have come to carry you home

And all will turn
To silver glass
A light on the water
All souls pass

Hope fades
Into the world of night
Through shadows falling
Out of memory and time
Don't say we have come now to the end
White shores are calling
You and I will meet again

And you'll be here in my arms
Just sleeping

[Chorus]

And all will turn
To silver glass
A light on the water
Grey ships pass
Into the West
```

###   yesterday once more
```
When I was young I'd listen to the radio
Waiting for my favorite songs
When they played I'd sing along
It made me smile

Those were such happy times and not so long ago
How I wondered where they'd gone
But they're back again just like a long lost friend
All the songs I loved so well

Every shalalala, every oho, oho
Still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling that they're starting to sing's
So fine

When they get to the part where he's breaking her heart
It can really make me cry
Just like before
It's yesterday once more

(Shoobidoo, wangdang)
(Shoobidoo, wangdang)

Looking back on how it was in years gone by
And the good times that I had
Makes today seem rather sad
So much has changed

It was songs of love that I would sing to them
And I'd memorize each word
Those old melodies still sound so good to me
As they melt the years away

Every shalalala, every oho, oho
Still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling that they're starting to sing's
So fine

All my best memories come back clearly to me
Some can even make me cry
Just like before
It's yesterday once more

(Shoobidoo, wangdang)
(Shoobidoo, wangdang)

Every shalalala, every oho, oho
Still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling that they're starting to sing's
So fine

Every shalalala, every oho, oho
Still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling that they're starting to sing's
So fine
```











#### never enough lyrics
```
[Verse]
I'm tryin' to hold my breath
Let it stay this way
Can't let this moment end
You set off a dream in me
Getting louder now
Can you hear it echoing?

[Pre-Chorus]
Take my hand
Will you share this with me?
'Cause darling, without you

[Chorus]
All the shine of a thousand spotlights
All the stars we steal from the night sky
Will never be enough, never be enough
Towers of gold are still too little
These hands could hold the world but it'll
Never be enough, never be enough

[Post-Chorus]
For me, never, never
Never, never
Never, for me, for me
Never enough, never enough, never enough
For me, for me, for me

[Chorus]
All the shine of a thousand spotlights
All the stars we steal from the night sky
Will never be enough, never be enough
Towers of gold are still too little
These hands could hold the world but it'll
Never be enough, never be enough

[Post-Chorus]
For me, never, never
Never, never
Never, for me, for me
Never enough, never, never
Never enough, never, never
Never enough
For me, for me, for me

[Outro]
For me
```
